## About Zephyr 🤖💨

Zephyr is a powerful event management bot designed for the TruckersMP community. Our advanced technology is powered by OpenAI, and we use it to detect event invites and manage events using a series of customizable variables. Although we describe ourselves as "AI Influenced," our operations and decision-making processes are heavily reliant on AI technology.

Please note that contributions to Zephyr are not currently accepted as it is not an open-source project.

We hope that this repository provides useful resources for all users of Zephyr. If you have any questions or issues with the bot or any of these resources, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know! 🙌
